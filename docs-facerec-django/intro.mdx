# Face Recognition with Machine Learning in Django, Deploy in AWS

Welcome to the AI and ML Enthusiast Course: Building a Face Recognition Web App with Django, Machine Learning, and Cloud Deployment on AWS!

Embark on an exciting journey into Artificial Intelligence as we delve into the realms of Computer Vision and Face Recognition within the expansive field of AI and ML.
This course is designed to guide you through the entire development process of an end-to-end project, catering to both machine learning and web development enthusiasts.

## Course Phases:

### Phase 1: Machine Learning - Face Identity Recognition

- Image processing techniques with OpenCV
- Prerequisites of the course: Python installation and library setup
- Face Detection using OpenCV and Deep Neural Networks
- Feature extraction using deep neural networks
- Training machine learning models: logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest
- Combining models with a Voting Classifier (stacking method)
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning for face recognition

### Phase 2: Machine Learning - Facial Emotion Recognition

- Application of machine learning techniques from face identity recognition
- Integration of detection and recognition models into a pipeline

### Phase 3: Django Web App Development

- Web application development in Django
- Rendering HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the frontend
- Backend development in Python using the MVT (Models, Views, and Templates) framework
- Designing a SQLite database for the Django app
- Interfacing machine learning pipeline models with the MVT framework
- Styling the app using Bootstrap

### Phase 4: Deployment / Production on AWS Cloud

- Deployment of the Django Web App on AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Utilizing the AWS Free Tier for 12 months
- Accessing the app globally through a provided URL/domain
- Troubleshooting and error resolution during deployment

### Course Highlights:

- In-depth learning of OpenCV for image processing
- Training models for Face Recognition and Facial Emotion Recognition
- Django web app development with MVT framework
- Integration of machine learning models into the web app
-  Deployment on AWS Elastic Beanstalk with a focus on the AWS Free Tier
