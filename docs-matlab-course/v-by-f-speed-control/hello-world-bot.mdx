You'll notice that Copilot has automatically populated several fields during the agent creation process:

#### Review and Validation

Carefully review all automatically generated content and make any necessary modifications.

> **Important:** All content is *AI-generated and may contain inaccuracies*. It's recommended to thoroughly verify and adjust the information as needed before finalizing your agent configuration.

- Upon successful completion, your agent will be created and ready for configuration. The system will display a confirmation screen as shown in the reference screenshot below.

**Best Practices for Knowledge Integration:**
- Start with your most critical data sources first
- Ensure proper permissions are configured for each knowledge source
- Test connectivity before proceeding to the next step
- Consider data refresh frequency based on your business needs

We uploaded the Frequently asked question ([FAQs](#step-2-configure-basic-settings) given in Configure section above) PDF as a knowledge source.

**Pre-Publication Checklist:**
