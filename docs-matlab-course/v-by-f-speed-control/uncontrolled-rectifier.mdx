# Uncontrolled Rectifiers in MATLAB

Welcome to the introduction of Simscape Electrical in MATLAB/Simulink. This document serves as the course material for understanding uncontrolled rectifiers, specifically focusing on **diode rectifiers**.

## What is a Rectifier?

Diodes are extensively used in rectifier circuits. A **rectifier** is an electronic circuit that converts an alternating current (AC) signal into a unidirectional (direct current) signal. Essentially, a rectifier functions as an AC-to-DC converter and can also be considered an absolute value converter.

When an AC input voltage `Vs` is applied to a rectifier circuit, the output voltage `Vo` follows the waveform of the input voltage, but with a crucial difference: the negative portions of the input signal are converted to positive values. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:

**`Vo = |Vs|`**

Where |Vs| represents the absolute value of the input voltage.

## Classification of Rectifiers

Rectifiers are classified based on the type of input supply into two main categories:

### 1. Single-Phase Rectifiers
These rectifiers operate with single-phase AC input and are further subdivided into:
- **Half-wave rectifiers**: Convert only one half of the AC waveform
- **Full-wave rectifiers**: Convert both halves of the AC waveform

### 2. Three-Phase Rectifiers
These rectifiers operate with three-phase AC input systems and are commonly used in industrial applications requiring higher power conversion.

## Important Notes

- **Single-phase half-wave rectifiers** represent the simplest type of rectifier configuration. However, due to their poor efficiency and high ripple content, they are **not commonly used in industrial applications**.

- For the purpose of this course and analysis, **diodes are considered to be ideal**. This assumption simplifies calculations by neglecting forward voltage drop and reverse leakage current.


## Learning Focus

In this section, we will concentrate on **uncontrolled rectifiers**, which use diodes as the primary switching elements. Unlike controlled rectifiers that use thyristors or other controllable switches, uncontrolled rectifiers provide a fixed output voltage relationship with the input voltage.
