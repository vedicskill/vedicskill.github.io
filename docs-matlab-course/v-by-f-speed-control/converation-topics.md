# Building Conversation Topics

Topics are the building blocks of your copilot's conversation logic. Let's create your first topic.

### Understanding Topics

A **topic** represents a specific conversation path that includes:

- **Trigger phrases**: What users say to start this conversation
- **Conversation flow**: The bot's responses and questions
- **Actions**: What the bot can do (send messages, call APIs, etc.)

### Creating Your First Topic

1. **Navigate to Topics** in the left panel
2. **Click "New topic"** 
3. **Choose "From blank"** to start fresh

### Defining Trigger Phrases

Add phrases that will activate this topic:

- "Hello"
- "Hi there" 
- "Good morning"
- "Hey"
- "Greetings"

### Building the Conversation Flow

Use the visual conversation designer to create your bot's responses:

1. **Add a message node**: "Hello! Welcome to my first copilot."
2. **Add a question node**: "How can I help you today?"
3. **Create response options**: Provide multiple choice answers
4. **Add follow-up actions**: Based on user selections
