# Parameter and Statistic
In statistics, it is important to distinguish between parameters and statistics. 
A parameter is a numerical value that describes a characteristic of an entire population. 
For example, the average height of all students in a school or the overall standard deviation of income in a country are parameters. 
These values are often represented using Greek letters, such as μ (mu) for the population mean and σ (sigma) for the population standard deviation.

Below given table illustrate difference between parameter and statistic


| **Parameter**                                                                                 | **Statistics**                                                                          |

| Numerical value that summarizes a characteristic of the entire population.                    | Numerical value that summarizes a characteristic of a sample taken from the population. |
| Examples include the population mean, population standard deviation, or population proportion | Examples include the sample mean, sample standard deviation, or sample proportion.      |
| Often denoted by Greek letters <br/>𝜇 – population mean,<br/>𝜎 – population standard deviation  | Often denoted by Roman letters <br/> _x̅_- sample mean <br/>𝑠 – sample standard deviation |
