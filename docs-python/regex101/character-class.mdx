# Character Classes

Character classes allow you to define a set of characters where any single character from that set will match.

|------------|-------------|
| `[cs]` | Matches either "c" or "s" (e.g., `/licen[cs]e/` matches "licence" or "license") |
| `[0-9]` | Matches any digit from 0 to 9 |
| `[a-z]` | Matches any lowercase letter |
| `[A-Z]` | Matches any uppercase letter |
| `[0-9a-zA-Z]` | Matches any alphanumeric character |
| `[^0-9]` | Matches any character that is NOT a digit |
| `[^a-z]` | Matches any character that is NOT a lowercase letter |
