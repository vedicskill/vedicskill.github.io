# Practice Exercises

### Excerise 1: Basic Pattern Matching

Consider this example string:
```
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This is outside (this is inside)
```

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Match the string "fox" and provide its range | 16-19 |
| How many times does "is" appear in the string? | 4 |
| Match the pattern "(this is inside)" and provide its range | 61-77 |

### Excerise 2: Using OR Operator (pipe)

For the string:
```
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west. Birds sing in the morning or evening.
```

| Question | Pattern |
|----------|---------|
| Match either "sun" or "moon" | `sun|moon` |
| Match either "east" or "west" | `east|west` |
| Match either "morning" or "evening" | `morning|evening` |
| Match either "rises", "sets", or "sing" | `rises|sets|sing` |
| Match either "The" or "Birds" | `The|Birds` |

### Excerise 3: Character Set, dot(.)

For this data:
```
Contact Information:
John Doe - john.doe@example.com - (555) 123-4567
Mary Smith - mary_smith@email.net - 555.987.6543

```

| Question | Pattern |
|----------|---------|
| Match any single vowel | `[aeiou]` |
| Match either "John" or "Tom" | `John|Tom` |
| Match any character that is NOT a digit | `[^0-9]` |
| Match either "com" or "net" in email domains | `com|net` |
| Match any single digit in phone numbers | `[0-9]` |

| Match any single uppercase letter | `[A-Z]` |
| Match any character that is not a letter or number | `[^0-9a-zA-Z]` |


### Excerise 4: Quantiers

Consider the below example string and Use the "The Curious Case of the Missing Code" text to answer the following questions.

```
The Curious Case of the Missing Code

John_Smith123 was panicking. It was 9:30 AM on April 15, 2025, and he had just realized that the crucial code files for Project-X2021 were missing from his laptop. Yesterday at 17:45, everything had been fine when he left the office at 42 Maple Street, Suite #301.

He quickly sent an email to his boss (anna.director@techcorp.com) and his team members (dev.team@techcorp.com):

Subject: URGENT - Missing Project Files
Body: Team, I can't locate the following files:
- main_v3.2.py
- config_prod.json
- api_keys.txt (IP: 192.168.1.100)

I've checked my backups from 2023-12-01 through 2025-03-15 but found nothing. Has anyone committed changes to the repository at http://git.techcorp.com/projects/x2021? My phone number is (555) 123-4567 if you need to reach me urgently. The project deadline is in 72 hours!

Lisa responded first at 9:42 AM: "I saved a copy at C:\Projects\Backup\X2021-backup.zip. The password is XB21-9$f5. You can also check with Mark who was working late yesterday."

John sighed with relief. Crisis averted! Now he needed to update the project documentation with proper file paths like /usr/local/bin/project-x/ for Linux users and C:\Program Files\Project-X\ for Windows users.

He made a note to call Lisa later at +1-555-987-6543 to thank her properly.
```
Create regular expressions that match exactly what's requested (nothing more, nothing less).

> Basic Character Sets

1. Create a pattern that matches all instances of dates in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
2. Write a regex that finds all alphanumeric identifiers that contain both letters and numbers (like "John_Smith123" or "Project-X2021").
3. Match all times in the HH:MM AM/PM format.

> Predefined Character Classes

4. Create a pattern using \d and \w to extract all phone numbers in the format (555) 123-4567 or +1-555-987-6543.
5. Write a regex using \s and \S to find all file paths (both Windows and Linux style).
6. Develop a pattern using \w, \d, and \s to match all file names with version numbers (like "main_v3.2.py").

> Metacharacters and Alternation

7. Use the pipe operator (|) to match either email addresses or web URLs.
8. Create a pattern with the dot (.) metacharacter to find all text within parentheses.
9. Write a regex that matches IP addresses like 192.168.1.100.

> Combined Challenge

10. Create a comprehensive pattern that extracts all forms of contact information (emails and phone numbers) from the text.


**Solution**

1. Pattern to match dates in YYYY-MM-DD format:
   ```
   \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}
   ```

2. Pattern for alphanumeric identifiers with both letters and numbers:
   ```
   [A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*\d+[A-Za-z0-9_]*
   ```
   Matches: "John_Smith123", "Project-X2021", "XB21-9$f5" (part of it)

3. Pattern for times in HH:MM AM/PM format:
   ```
   \d{1,2}:\d{2}\sAM|\d{1,2}:\d{2}\sPM
   ```
   Matches: "9:30 AM", "9:42 AM"

4. Pattern for phone numbers using \d and \w:
   ```
   \(\d{3}\)\s\d{3}-\d{4}|\+\d-\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}
   ```
   Matches: "(555) 123-4567", "+1-555-987-6543"

5. Pattern for file paths using \s and \S:
   ```
   [A-Z]:\\[^\s]+|/\S+/
   ```
   Matches: "C:\Projects\Backup\X2021-backup.zip", "C:\Program Files\Project-X\", "/usr/local/bin/project-x/"

6. Pattern for filenames with version numbers using \w, \d, and \s:
   ```
   \w+_v\d+\.\d+\.\w+
   ```
   Matches: "main_v3.2.py"

7. Pattern for email addresses or web URLs using pipe operator:**
   ```
   [a-zA-Z0-9_.]+@[a-zA-Z0-9_.]+\.[a-z]+|http://[^\s]+
   ```
   Matches: "anna.director@techcorp.com", "dev.team@techcorp.com", "http://git.techcorp.com/projects/x2021"

8. Pattern with dot metacharacter to find text in parentheses:
   ```
   \(.*?\)
   ```
   Matches: "(555) 123-4567", "(IP: 192.168.1.100)"

9. Pattern for IP addresses:
   ```
   \d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}
   ```
   Matches: "192.168.1.100"

10. Comprehensive pattern for contact information:
    ```
    [a-zA-Z0-9_.]+@[a-zA-Z0-9_.]+\.[a-z]+|\(\d{3}\)\s\d{3}-\d{4}|\+\d-\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}
    ```
    Matches all email addresses and phone numbers in the text

### Excerise 6 - Boundary Matchers
These questions are based on the following example string:

```
Hello world! This is line one.
World, hello! This is line two.
HelloWorld is a single word.
The word "hello" appears in quotes.
This line ends with hello
hello starts this line and world ends it with world
com.example.domain is a domain name
user@example.com is an email address.
2023-05-15 is a date format.
The final line ends the entire text.
```

**Questions on ^ (Caret) Boundary**

1. Write a regex pattern that matches any line beginning with the word "Hello".

## Warning

The dot (.) is a very powerful metacharacter that can create problems if not used properly, as it matches almost any character.
